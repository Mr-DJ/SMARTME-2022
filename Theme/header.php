                  <p>Talk Title: Recent Advancements in Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs)

Abstract: Frequency selective surface (FSS) is a periodic structure designed to selectively reflect, transmit, and/or absorb incident electromagnetic (EM) wave. They are usually constructed by printing an infinite array of metallic patterns on single/both sides of a dielectric substrate. Since the last few decades, these FSSs have attracted significant research interest owing to their simple design, easy to fabricate, and wide adaptability. They have found a wide range of EM applications, such as absorbers, filters, polarizers, high impedance surfaces, rasorbers, antennas, and so forth, across various frequency ranges. This talk will center around several design aspects of these microwave devices exploiting the FSS concepts. <br><br> Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh has completed his Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, Howrah in 2009, and the Master of Technology (M.Tech) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, in 2013 and 2017, respectively. Afterwards, he had worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.

					He is currently working as an Assistant Professor at Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. His research is primarily focused on electromagnetics, frequency selective surfaces, reconfigurable circuits, and meta surfaces.</p>

                  <p>Talk Title: Antenna Design and Optimization Using Machine Learning

Abstract: Wireless communications have become the ubiquitous wide-ranging applications. Antennas are critical part of any wireless system for maximizing efficiency and data rates. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.  Antennas are becoming more and more complex each day with increase in demand for their use in variety of devices (smart phones, autonomous driving to mention a couple); antenna designers can take advantage of machine learning to generate trained models for their physical antenna designs and perform fast and intelligent optimization on these trained models. Using the trained models, different optimization algorithms and goals can be run quickly, in seconds, for comparison of different designs. This talk presents the process of fast and intelligent optimization by Design Exploration and machine learning. Examples to showcase the advantages of using machine learning for antenna design and optimization will be presented. <br><br> Dr. C.J. Reddy is Vice President, Business Development-Electromagnetics for Americas at Altair Engineering, Inc. (www.altair.com). Dr. Reddy was awarded the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Visiting Fellowship to work at Communications Research Center in Ottawa during 1991-1993 and was awarded the US National Research Council (NRC) Resident Research Associateship in 1993 to work at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. While conducting research at NASA Langley, he developed various computational codes for electromagnetics and received a Certificate of Recognition from NASA for development of a hybrid Finite Element Method/Method of Moments/Geometrical Theory of Diffraction code for cavity backed aperture antenna analysis. He also worked as Research Professor at Hampton University from 1995 to 2000. Dr. Reddy was the President of Applied EM, Inc (2000-2017), where he led several Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects for the DoD and NASA. He was also the President of EM Software & Systems (USA) Inc (2002-2014) and led the marketing of the EM Simulation tool, Feko in North America. EM Software & Systems (USA) Inc was acquired by Altair in 2014.

Dr. Reddy is a Fellow of IEEE, Fellow of ACES (Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society) and a Fellow of AMTA (Antenna Measurement Techniques Association). Dr. Reddy served on ACES Board of Directors from 2006 to 2012 and again from 2015 to 2018. Dr. Reddy was awarded Distinguished Alumni Professional Achievement Award by his alma mater, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, India in 2015. He published 37 journal papers, 77 conference papers and 18 NASA Technical Reports to date. Dr. Reddy is a co-author of the book, “Antenna Analysis and Design Using FEKO Electromagnetic Simulation Software,” published in June 2014 by SciTech Publishing (now part of IET). Dr. Reddy is serving as an Associate Editor for the newly introduced, IEEE Open Journal of Antennas of Propagation. He is appointed by IEEE Board of Directors to the position of IEEE Fellow Committee Member for the term 2020-2021. Dr. Reddy is elected as a member of AMTA Board of Directors for a three-year term starting Jan 2020 and is the Technical Coordinator for AMTA 2020 and AMTA 2021 Conferences.
